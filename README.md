# DDS_Covid-19_Huancavelica

The objective of this work is to identify the levels of perception of insecurity regarding property crime in the districts of Metropolitan Lima in 2017, differentiated by district. For this purpose, the National Victimization Survey (ENEVIC) 2017 - Module 300: Citizen Insecurity was used. This project was carried out jointly with my colleague Giovanni Arriola Laura.
The objective of this study is to identify the situation of infected, hospitalized, vaccinated and deaths during the COVID-19 health emergency in the Huancavelica region of Peru. All these scenarios were identified by sex, age group, educational level and work sector. In addition, in the case of those vaccinated, a distinction was made between those who received the first, second and third doses.
